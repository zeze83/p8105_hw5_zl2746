``` r
homicide_df = read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
```

- Describe the raw data.

  There are 52179 observations with 12 variables in this data set. The
  variables are uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first,
  victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon,
  disposition.

- Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize
  within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number
  of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed
  without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).
